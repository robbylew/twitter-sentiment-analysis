# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
## Repository Update

Thank you for your interest in the **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** project.

Unfortunately, Iâ€™ve made the decision to keep the code private as I plan to publish this project as a full-fledged online tool. As such, this repository no longer contains the code or documentation related to the project.

I sincerely apologize for any confusion or inconvenience caused to those who followed this link expecting to view the source code. If you're interested in learning more about the project or discussing it further, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for understanding,
**Robert Lewis**
